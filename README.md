# sort

## Problem

Given: Two lists of integers L1 and L2;
Output: The largest number that occurs in L1 but does not occur in L2, or "None" if there is no such number.

## Details

In the file, each list consists of a sequence of positive integers, one integer per line, with a line containing a 0 delimiting the two lists.
Example files are from l1 to l11

The algorithm I choose is conbination of heap and queue
I will sort the list first to find the largest number then make compare

## Sample Output

Here are some file you can use for testing.
"l1 (Answer: 5)
"l2 (Answer: NONE)
"l3 (Answer: NONE)
"l4 (Answer: NONE)
"l5 (Answer: 923095723)
"l6 (Answer: 50000)
"l7 (Answer: 78)
"l8 (Answer: NONE)
"l9 (Answer: 199)
"l10 (Answer: 2147483647)
"l11 (Answer: 2147483640)
